Sarvadrishti is our solution to the Smnart India Hackathon 2024 Problem Statement - 1788, a facial recognition technology in the Madhya Pradesh police Department.

Features:
Decentralized Database:
We use the Inter Planetary File System (IPFS), a cutting-edge technology that ensures our data is stored in a decentralized manner. This means that instead of being stored in one place, your data is distributed across multiple locations, making it extremely secure and virtually impossible to hack.

Optimized Algorithms:
Our facial recognition algorithms are fine-tuned to achieve high accuracy, even when running on less powerful hardware. This is a significant accomplishment as it ensures precise identification and verification, making our system reliable.

Local Hosting:
By hosting the system locally, we ensure that it performs efficiently even with limited internet connectivity. This makes it robust and quick, providing a seamless user experience without relying heavily on internet speed.


Future Advancements:
Upgrade Hardware:
We plan to invest in better GPUs and high-quality webcams. This will enhance our system's processing power and image quality, leading to even more accurate and faster facial recognition.

Integrate webRTC:
By integrating webRTC, we can improve our real-time communication capabilities, making our system more interactive and responsive.

Access Paid Versions:
Switching to paid versions of encryption and hashing software will significantly speed up these processes, enhancing overall performance.
